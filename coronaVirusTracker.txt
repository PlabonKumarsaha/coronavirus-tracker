# Spring boot steps

1.Get the data from the link and parse it.

2.Create a Service name CoronaVirusDataService which has a method of fetchVirusData.
This will call a HTTPclient insatnce and HttpRequest. Make the fetchVirusdata method a
@PostConstruct..So when the service is instanciated thhis method will be called. That's why postConst annotation is 
used. This will load the csv file.

3. we will use a 3rd party CSV parsing library. we passed the body of csv in that library.
Now we want the system to be updated on regular basis. So we use an annotaion call
@Scheduled which will make the method fetchVirusData updated in a fixed delay. an annotation named
@Enabled scduling must be done as well to let the main method know anout the sceduling.


4. Now we create an model name LocationStats which has the members name state,country,latest total in the class.These will have getter and setter.
Now we make a list of that model class in the service.

5. Now we will be making a controller which will help us get an to show an url to show in the UIs. Create a home template.
With the help of controller we will render the UI component..We use @GetMapping to return the home page(works for thymleaf).

6.Controller is used for rendering the desired pages. Now in the Controller we are going to autowire the CoronaVirusDataSer instance to use it to show the data.

Spring home(Model model){

model.addAttribute("locationStat",CoronaVirusService.getAllstat());

// now we will loop through the allstat List with thymleaf
}

7. Now we will loop through the allstat in thymleaf ang get all the values.
